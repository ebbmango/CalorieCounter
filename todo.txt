STOPPED AT CREATE ITEM

- Create custom TextInput component

CREATE ITEM SCREEN

- Add custom TextInput to each field of Create Item
- Implement validation
- Create the item and redirect to the list screen, remounting it if need be (or invert the flatlist?)

EDIT ITEM SCREEN

- Use same layout as ITEM SCREEN
- Validation should be the same

LIST SCREEN

- Implement adding to meal logic

HOME SCREEN

- Get all entries and run diagnostics

KNOWN ISSUES:

- unit picker doesn't always scroll on click

WOULD BE INTERESTING TO DO:

I've noticed that when some pages need prior fetching before rendering, the screen 
transition animations don't look as smooth, because the blank screen suddenly loads
while sliding. It'd be cool to make the loading screen have the same visual layout.
