TODO:

handle entries with deleted food items

KNOWN ISSUES:

unit picker doesn't always scroll on click

WOULD BE INTERESTING TO DO:

I've noticed that when some pages need prior fetching before rendering, the screen 
transition animations don't look as smooth, because the blank screen suddenly loads
while sliding. It'd be cool to make the loading screen have the same visual layout.
